## Superspot

Superspot is a robotic dog capable of receiving and executing audio commands, developed by San Wisnoski (ECE, '27), Audrey Renaud (MechE '27), Shauna Sperou (MechE '27), Luca Odio (MechE '27), and Karis Moon (Engineering with Computing '27) for our Principles of Engineering final project.

Superspot is equipped with an Arduino R4 WiFi and hosts its own server. A user on the same network can use our website to send the following voice commands: "forward", "backward", "sit", "lay down", "stand up", "shake", "nod", and "heel". 

In this repo, you will find the following code: 
* Commands contains both the web server code for interpreting and sending the voice commands, as well as the arduino code for recieving and executing the commands.
* The fetch folders contain code for our attempts to use UWB, bluetooth, and ultrasonic sensors to track and move to the location of a moving ball.
