# BettaFish Chess Engine

A Python implementation of a Minimax next-best move solver for Chess. BetTaFish plays at a rating ~1600 ELO. 
This implementation is a submodule for [this repo](github.com/eddydpan/chess_bot) where we implement
it for a WidowX Robot Manipulator to play against a real user.
